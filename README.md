Hi Everyone! 👋🏻

I'm a DevRel at roadmap.sh, Product Analyst at LUMS, Chairperson - IEEE UET Lahore & Planning Committee at AWS Community Pakistan aimed at developing communities and empowering the youth.

I've worked as Front-end & UI/UX developer for the past 2 years and now transitioning towards Cloud/DevOps Engineering. Meanwhile I'm also a freelancer doing various projects in Ai/ML. 🚀☁️

In addition to this, having a product oriented mindset I've won & arranged multiple Hackathons introducing innovative products and further providing assistance to bring new ones into the eco-system 🦾
