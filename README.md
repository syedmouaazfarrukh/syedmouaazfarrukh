Hi Everyone! 👋🏻

I'm an undergrad of EE(CS) currently working as the Chairperson IEEE UET Lahore and member of Planning Committee AWS Community Pakistan developing communities and empowering the youth. 🛠.

I've worked as Front-end & UI/UX developer for the past 2 years and now transitioning towards Cloud/DevOps Engineering. Meanwhile I also freelance in the field of Ai/ML. 🚀☁️

In addition to this, having a product oriented mindset I've worked multiple Hackathons, coming up with innovative products and further providing assistance to bring new ones into the eco-system 🦾
